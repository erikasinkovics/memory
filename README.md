# Memory Game in ReactJS
Welcome to the gh repository of my first ReactJS project, a simple memory game with the purpose of matching all the 8 pairs of cards.

This project was coded **from scratch** using the knowledge I have acquired after taking my first ReactJS course [on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact).

### The project demonstrates the following concepts:
- class based components
- props
- state management
- conditional rendering
